Inconsistency in programming can lead to many serious trouble when the size of our project grows. To counter this many linter are out there like eslint, jshint, jslint etc. (I am talking about javascript). They help you to be consistent in your semicolons, quotes etc. all that good stuff. In this blog post I am going to show you how you can setup ESLint for visual studio code which is a very nice text editor I think better than sublime text.
